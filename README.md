Under Construction

This will create a self-hosted dockerised elastic and kibana stack to view my itunes xml data.

The plan is to use some LLMs or Vectorising to create some interesting analysis.

Claude is going to help.

File needed in root directory can be seen in the .gitignore

```gitignore
# iTunes Music Library XML file - found in /Users/username/Music/iTunes/ 
# for osx, not sure about windows
iTunes\ Music\ Library.xml
```
